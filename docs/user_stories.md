# Ferment — Key User Stories

### 1. “Add & Play”  
As a Mac user, I want to easily add a Windows game (.exe/.msi) and have it appear in my game library with cover art and description, so I can launch and play it in one click.

### 2. “Unified Library”  
As a gamer, I want to see all my installed games from Steam and Epic in a single, beautiful library, so I don’t have to switch between multiple launchers.

### 3. “Wishlist”  
As a user, I want to add games to a wishlist and see when they become available for Mac/GPTK, so I don’t miss games I want to play.

### 4. “In-game Overlay”  
As a player, I want a GameBar overlay with FPS and hardware stats, so I can monitor performance and take quick screenshots while gaming.

### 5. “Night Mode & Modern Design”  
As a Mac enthusiast, I want Ferment to look and feel native, support dark/night mode, and integrate with the latest macOS visual effects (Liquid Glass).

### 6. “Do Not Disturb Integration”  
As a focused gamer, I want the app to automatically enable macOS Do Not Disturb mode during gameplay, so nothing distracts me.

### 7. “Gameplay Analytics”  
As a statistics fan, I want to see how much time I’ve spent in each game, view achievements, and get insights about my gaming habits.
